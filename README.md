# Heat and Road Traffic Mortality in 272 LA Cities


## Files

Files names are ordered in their intended execution order. Files
`10` and `11` must be run before any of the analysis code.
`12`-`14` are for main analysis (`12` nonimputed, pooled using median; `13` imputed, using Rubin's rule; `14` simply compares models across different datasets and temp measures)
`15`-`17` for subgroup analyses by sex, age, and mode of transport.
`18` adds interaction for city-level effect modifiers

| `18_interaction.R`                  | Includes interaction with city-level effect modifiers (i.e., temp mean, temp std, street segment length and peak-hour travel time)                                                               |
| `19_climate cluster.R`              | Stratifies imputed analysis by six temperature clusters (cluster_ward_std_6)                                                                                                                     |
